                        <h1>Welcome to RHCSA Study</h1>
                        <p>RHCSA Study was a side project from my personal study of the Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam. Since I collected information of the exam in my personal wiki, I wanted to share this out with friends and decided it would be even more helpful to others. </p>

                        <h2>Study suggestions</h2>
                        <p>In the wiki I have listed the books I used on my personal study path as well as other sites. My recommendation is to use all available resources you find, from man pages to white papers, even YouTube videos.</p>

                        <h2>What will I need</h2>
                        <p>While having books based on the RHCSA exam are helpful, all of the information we will cover is available freely across the Internet. The exam topics are listed on Red Hat's site, and any information can be found either from Red Hat documentation or from other sources. In addition I would recommend you have either a computer able to install Linux to run through the labs or computer able to run a virtualzation software. We will cover more details on this subject in the wiki.</p>

                        <h3>How can I download Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h3>
                        <p>You can download a trial version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that will work for 30 days. For the documentation and labs, I used CentOS, which is a free rebuild of RHEL. This is available freely on the Internet, and you can use other RHEL rebuilds such as Scienfitic Linux.</p>

                    <h3>What is the RHCSA?</h3>
                    <p><h5>The RHCSA is an exam given by the Red Hat, Inc. This exam is based on performance rather than a multiple choice test. You are given random tasks to complete and a live system to work on within a short time frame. Due to the real world skills this exam requires, the study time is typically longer and more difficult than typical exams. </h5></p>
